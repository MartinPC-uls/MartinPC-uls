Hi, my name is Martín Pizarro and I'm from Chile. I'm studying Software Engineer (A.K.A Ingeniería en computación) at Universidad de La Serena (ULS).
I've got experience on programming languages as C, C++, Java, C#, Lua and MySQL. I'm currently learning JavaScript and I'm interested on learning HTML + CSS, Python and Ruby.
